This a project that simulates a crud application, with pagination and search included.

It uses NextJS 14 (app router), Styled Components and React Hook Form.

It should be noted that, without Zustand/Redux, the application needed to use a lot of useEffect hook, to make sure that the state reflects the correct information expected.

## Getting Started

First, install the project on your local machine:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
